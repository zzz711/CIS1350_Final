          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Rhapsody of Fire (formerly known as Rhapsody) is an Italian
            symphonic power metal band formed by Luca Turilli and Alex
            Staropoli, widely seen as a pioneer of the symphonic power metal
            subgenre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since forming in 1993 as Thundercross, the band has released twelve
            studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, and a Live DVD. Rhapsody of
            Fire is known for its conceptual lyrics that constitute a fantasy
            story throughout all of their albums from 1997 to 2011. After using
            the moniker of Rhapsody for nearly ten years, the band changed their
            name to Rhapsody of Fire in 2006 due to trademark issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2011, following the release of their album From
            <i>Chaos to Eternity</i> which concluded The Dark Secret Saga, and
            after 18 years as co-leader of the band, Turilli left Rhapsody of
            Fire (on good terms) to form a new Rhapsody band, Luca Turilli's
            Rhapsody, along with two other members who left with him, Dominique
            Leurquin, Patrice Guers. They describe their discography as a
            parallel continuation of Rhapsody of Fire's discography, with their
            first album being their own "Rhapsody's 11th album" and consider
            that they didn't leave the band, rather that it amicably split in
            two.

            In July 2013, Tom Hess respectfully parted ways with the band due to
            "philosophical differences" with Alex Staropoli. Hess would not be
            replaced, with the band continuing with just one guitarist.
            Recording for the band's next studio album,
            <i>Dark Wings of Steel</i>, also began in July 2013.
            <i>Dark Wings of Steel</i> was released at the end of the year and
            was the band's first album not to be based on the band's fantasy
            saga, The Algalord Chronicles, which spanned from
            <i>Legendary Tales</i> to <i>From Chaos to Eternity</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Songwriting for a followup to <i> Dark Wings of Steel</i> began in
            the Fall of 2014. Album artwork and the track listings for the new
            album, titled <i>Into the Legend</i>, were revealed in November
            2015. The album was released in January 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a short tour to promote the new album, Fabio Lione announced
            his departure on September 28, 2016. Drummer Alex Holzwarth also
            announced his departure on the band's Facebook page a couple of days
            later on October 9, 2016. On November 11, 2016, the band announced
            their new lead vocalist, Giacomo Voli. Manu Lotter was announced as
            the new drummer on December 22, 2016.
