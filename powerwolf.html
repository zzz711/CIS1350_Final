          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Powerwolf, often stylized as POWERWOLF, is a German power metal band
            founded in 2003 in Saarbrücken by members of Red Aim. The band
            consists of vocalist Karsten Brill as "Attila Dorn", lead guitarist
            Benjamin Buss as "Matthew Greywolf", bassist/rhythm guitarist David
            Vogt as "Charles Greywolf", keyboardist Christian Jost as "Falk
            Maria Schlegel" and drummer Roel van Helden. The group uses dark
            themes and images, musically and lyrically, contrary to traditional
            power metal music, as well as corpse paint, gothic-tinged
            compositions and songs about Transylvanian werewolf and vampire
            legends.

            Most of Powerwolf's albums were well received by fans and critics
            alike. The music is composed by the entire band, and the lyrics,
            written mostly by Matthew Greywolf, are inspired by Christianity and
            ancient Roman legends. Over the years a theme has developed which
            personifies the band members as werewolves, leading fans to refer to
            the band affectionately as "The Wolves".

      When asked if the mebers of Powerwolf are Christians or Satanists Matthew
      Greywolf had this to say:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Some people are confused because we never make a point of saying the
      silly words of which side we are on. A lot of people ask us, "Are you
      Satanists? Are you Christians?" And we never say anything about that, and
      we never will, because in what we do in Powerwolf, it’s not important what
      we as individuals believe or stand for. We sometimes describe religious
      history, we sometimes write about Satanism, Catholicism, or whatever, but
      we never judge anything. I think on one side, this is confusing people,
      but on the other side, a lot of people do understand that we only describe
      or write lyrics about something, not to deliver a message."
